## JamStream: Social Music Listening

JamStream is a mobile application that enhances the music listening experience by adding a social component. It allows users to create virtual rooms where they can listen to music together and chat in real-time, regardless of their physical location.

### The Problem

Traditional music streaming services like Spotify offer limited social features. While Spotify has a "Group Session" feature, it lacks persistent rooms, chat functionality, and the ability to discover public listening sessions.

### Our Solution

JamStream addresses these limitations by providing:

- Persistent listening rooms that continue even when the creator leaves
- Real-time chat functionality during music sessions
- Public room discovery for finding like-minded music fans
- Collaborative playlist creation and management

## Technical Architecture

JamStream is built using React Native for cross-platform compatibility, with TypeScript for type safety. The application integrates with the Spotify API for music streaming and metadata, while Firebase provides real-time database functionality for the chat and room state management.

```typescript
// Room creation example
const createRoom = async (userId: string, roomName: string) => {
  try {
    const roomRef = await firebase.firestore().collection('rooms').add({
      name: roomName,
      createdBy: userId,
      createdAt: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
      members: [userId],
      currentTrack: null,
      isPlaying: false
    });

    return roomRef.id;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating room:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## User Interface

The UI was designed in Figma with a focus on:

1. **Intuitive Navigation**: Easy access to rooms, playlists, and chat
2. **Real-time Feedback**: Visual cues for currently playing tracks and active users
3. **Consistent Styling**: Following material design principles with a dark theme optimized for music apps

## Challenges Overcome

- **Synchronization**: Ensuring all users hear the same part of a song simultaneously
- **Latency Management**: Minimizing delays in chat and music control actions
- **Spotify API Limitations**: Working within the constraints of the Spotify API's rate limits and permissions

## Future Enhancements

- Voice chat capabilities
- Music recommendation based on room participants' tastes
- Advanced DJ controls for room moderators
- Cross-platform integration with other music streaming services
